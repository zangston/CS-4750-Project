# CS-4750-Project: EchoShell
This repository consists of database and application code relating to our development efforts for the semester project for CS 4750: Database Systems

Our application seeks to mimic Spotify in functionality, but in the form of a UNIX shell terminal. [More information on our application and the reasoning behind our design choices here](https://github.com/zangston/CS-4750-Project/blob/main/Project%20Documents/0%20-%20Project%20Proposal.pdf)
